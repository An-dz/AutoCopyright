# Auto Copyright

A [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) plugin to automate adding the appropriate copyright text at the top of every file.

# Installation

## Package Control

Install [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).  Auto Copyright will show up in the package list.  This is the recommended installation method.

## Manual installation

Go to the "Packages" directory (`Preferences` / `Browse Packages...`).  Then clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/lifted-studios/AutoCopyright

# Options

Edit the settings file (it should open automatically the first time you use an Auto Copyright command):

*   `"owner": ""`

    You need to enter the text you want to show up as the copyright owner.

# Usage

The function shows up in the Command Palette as "Copyright: Insert Copyright".

## Insert Copyright

Adds the copyright text to the beginning of the file.  It will add itself after a shebang line, if any.
