# SublimeCopyright

A [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) plugin to automate adding and updating the appropriate copyright text at the top of every file.

# Installation

## Package Control

Install [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).  SublimeCopyright will show up in the package list.  This is the recommended installation method.

## Manual installation

Go to the "Packages" directory (`Preferences` / `Browse Packages...`).  Then clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/lee-dohm/SublimeCopyright

# Options

Edit the settings file (it should open automatically the first time you use a SublimeCopyright command):
